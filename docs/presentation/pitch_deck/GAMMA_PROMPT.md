## Gamma prompt (copy/paste)

### Topic

Create a startup pitch deck for **Dream Flow**: an **AI-powered bedtime story platform** with **revolutionary dual-backend freemium architecture** that solves AI unit economics - **Free tier uses device AI** (sustainable), **Premium tier uses cloud AI** (professional quality), with **Azure validation** and **Klaviyo retention**.

### Audience + purpose

- Audience: Microsoft Imagine Cup judges + investors
- Purpose: Show how intelligent tier architecture creates sustainable freemium economics, solves AI cost problem, and creates competitive moat through backend quality differentiation

### Constraints

- Output: **15 slides max** + appendix
- Tone: crisp, confident, competition-ready
- Style: modern, minimal, 3-5 bullets per slide
- Include: speaker notes for each slide

### Key facts MUST incorporate

**Product:** AI bedtime stories personalized by mood/routine; multi-modal (text+audio+visuals); offline-friendly.

**Revolutionary Architecture:**

- **Free → Local Backend**: Device AI (Tensor/Neural Engine) → Templates → Zero cloud costs
- **Premium/Family → Cloud Backend**: Professional AI pipeline → Advanced models → High quality
- **Smart fallback**: Cloud gracefully falls back to local if unavailable

**Azure Integration:**

- **Content Safety**: text+image moderation, stricter for children, fail-open design
- **Computer Vision**: accessibility captions, quality validation
- **App Service**: hosts premium cloud backend (Bicep IaC)

**Business Model:**

- **Free**: Device AI, 5 themes, standard quality (sustainable via local processing)
- **Premium ($9.99/mo)**: Cloud AI, 20+ themes, professional quality, unlimited
- **Family ($14.99/mo)**: Enhanced cloud AI, analytics, 6 members, child controls
- **Unit Economics**: Free users cost $0 (device processing), Premium funds infrastructure

**Growth:** Klaviyo tracking (Story Generated, Subscriptions, Streaks) → automated flows (welcome, reminders, upgrades)

**Market:** $4.9B SAM digital mindfulness/sleep; parents + professionals

**Ask:** $500K seed (product, growth, team, ops)
