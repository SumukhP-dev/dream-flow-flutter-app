## **Advanced Production Tips**

### **Multi-Take Strategy:**
1. **Record 3 complete versions**
2. **Vary energy levels** slightly in each take
3. **Use different story prompts** to show versatility
4. **Record B-roll content**: app navigation without narration
5. **Capture reaction shots**: genuine responses to generated content

### **Screen Recording Best Practices:**
- **Frame rate**: 60fps if possible, minimum 30fps
- **Resolution**: Native device resolution (don't scale down)
- **Recording area**: Full screen, not cropped
- **Touch indicators**: Enable if available (shows where you're tapping)
- **Audio capture**: Include system sounds and microphone

### **Presentation Techniques:**
- **Hand position**: Keep hands visible but not blocking screen
- **Navigation speed**: Slower than normal use - viewers need to see UI
- **Pause timing**: Allow 1-2 seconds for UI transitions
- **Voice pacing**: Slightly slower than normal conversation
- **Energy consistency**: Maintain enthusiasm throughout

## **Post-Production Workflow**

### **Video Editing (Optional but Recommended):**
- **Trim**: Ensure exactly 2:00 or under
- **Sync**: Align screen recording with presenter audio
- **Transitions**: Smooth cuts between presenter and screen

- **End card**: Include call-to-action or contact information

### **Quality Control Checklist:**
- [ ] Audio levels consistent throughout
- [ ] Screen recording is crisp and readable
- [ ] No dead air or awkward pauses
- [ ] All promised features demonstrated

## **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **App Performance Problems:**
- **Story generation timeout**: Use pre-generated backup story
- **Image loading issues**: Have static screenshots ready
- **Audio playback failure**: Explain feature while showing waveform/timer
- **App crashes**: Restart and use prepared content as "previously generated"

### **Recording Technical Issues:**
- **Poor screen quality**: Use device's maximum resolution setting
- **Audio sync problems**: Record presenter and screen separately, sync in editing
- **File size too large**: Compress using HandBrake or similar tool
- **Upload failures**: Try different platform or compress file further

### **Presentation Recovery:**
- **Forgot talking points**: Focus on visible UI and describe what's happening
- **Timing running long**: Skip detailed explanations, focus on core functionality
- **Lost enthusiasm**: Take 30-second break, re-energize, continue recording
- **Technical failure**: Switch to prepared screenshots with voice-over explanation
