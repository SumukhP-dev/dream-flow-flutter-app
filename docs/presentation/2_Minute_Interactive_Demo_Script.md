### **Story Creation Setup [0:15-0:35] - 20 seconds**

**[Navigate through app while talking - show HomeScreen to CreateStoryScreen]**

"After logging in, I'm taken to the story creation screen. Dream Flow personalizes stories based on three key elements: your current mood, your bedtime routine, and your story preferences."

**[Show Create Story Screen with input fields]**

"Let me fill these out: My mood tonight is 'excited but ready to wind down', my routine includes 'quiet time with soft music', and I'll select some theme preferences like 'gentle animals' and 'floating islands'."

**[Demonstrate filling out the mood, routine, and preference selection interfaces]**

### **Story Prompt & Theme Selection [0:35-0:55] - 20 seconds**

**[Show story prompt input and theme selection]**

"Now I'll describe what kind of story I want: 'Tell me a bedtime story about floating lanterns guiding a sleepy fox.' The app offers various preset themes, or I can create something completely custom."

**[Demonstrate theme selection and voice options]**

"I'll choose a soothing theme, and notice I can select different voice options for narration - there's 'alloy', 'luna', and 'verse' voices available."

**[Tap Generate button]**

"Now I hit Generate, and watch this - Dream Flow's AI pipeline starts working. It's creating the story text, generating audio narration, and preparing visual frames simultaneously."

### **AI Generation Process [0:55-1:25] - 30 seconds**

**[Show StreamingStoryScreen with live generation progress]**

"Here's the AI working in real-time. The app uses either local device AI for free users or cloud processing for premium features. You can see the story text being generated progressively - it's actually streaming the content as it's created."

**[Story text appears in the streaming interface]**

"And here's our personalized story beginning to appear: 'The sleepy fox wandered through the moonlit forest, following the gentle glow of floating lanterns...' Notice how it directly incorporates the elements I requested - the floating lanterns and the sleepy fox."

**[Show audio controls, visual frames, and interactive features]**

"There are playback controls, progress tracking, and the story automatically saves to my library. The app also includes reflection prompts and can even generate comprehension questions for educational value."

**[Demonstrate saving and library features]**

"Every story is saved with timestamps and personalization data, so Dream Flow learns what themes and styles work best for different moods and routines."
